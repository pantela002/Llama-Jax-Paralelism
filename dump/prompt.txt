    "Q: Josh decides to try flipping a house. He buys a house for $80,000 and then puts in $50,000 in repairs. This increased the value of the house by 150%. How much profit did he make?\n"
    "A: The cost of the house and repairs came out to 80,000 + 50,000 = $<<80000+50000=130000>>130,000\n"
    "He increased the value of the house by 80,000 * 1.5 = <<80000*1.5=120000>>120,000\n"
    "So the new value of the house is 120,000 + 80,000 = $<<120000+80000=200000>>200,000\n"
    "So he made a profit of 200,000 - 130,000 = $<<200000-130000=70000>>70,000\n"
    "F: #### 70000\n\n"
